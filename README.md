# Empower Mental Health Chatbot

A culturally sensitive AI-powered mental health chatbot using LangChain, GPT-4, Pinecone, and Flask. Developed as a master's capstone project at San Jos√© State University.
---
## Project Overview

This chatbot addresses global mental health challenges by:

- Offering culturally personalized responses  
- Supporting crisis detection and escalation  
- Integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Pinecone  
- Enabling real-time voice/text interaction with TTS/STT  
- Logging sessions for therapist reviews and continuity  

## Architecture Overview
```
Frontend (React) <--> Flask Backend (LangChain + GPT-4) <--> PostgreSQL + Pinecone
                    ‚Ü≥ Tools: PineconeSearch | WebSearch | ChatSummary | NearestTherapist
```

- Routing Agent: Dynamically selects tools or raw LLM  
- Tool-Enhanced Responses: Used for verified advice, cultural grounding, therapist lookup  
- Raw GPT-4 Responses: Used when personal empathy is more helpful  
- Dual Path Ranking: GPT-4 ranks both responses for final reply
